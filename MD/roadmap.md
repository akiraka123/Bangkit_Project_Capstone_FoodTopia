# Food Recipe App Development Roadmap

## 1. Planning & Requirement Gathering
- **Duration**: 1 week
- **Activities**:
  - Identify main features required in the app (login, recipe list, search, favorites, user profile, etc.).
  - Decide on technologies to use, including suitable Android libraries (e.g., Retrofit for API, Room for local database).
  - Plan the project structure in Android Studio.

## 2. Project Setup in Android Studio
- **Duration**: 1 week
- **Activities**:
  - Create a new project in Android Studio.
  - Configure basic dependencies in `build.gradle` (e.g., Retrofit, Glide/Picasso, Room, Firebase if necessary).
  - Set up a package structure to organize code into manageable modules (e.g., ui, data, network, model).

## 3. UI Design & Layout Development
- **Duration**: 2-3 weeks
- **Activities**:
  - Use XML to design layouts according to the provided design for screens like login, registration, home, search, recipe details, favorites, and profile.
  - Ensure responsive UI for various screen sizes.
  - Implement **Material Design** to give the app a modern and intuitive look.
  - Use components like **RecyclerView** to display lists of recipes.

## 4. Authentication Module (Login & Register)
- **Duration**: 1-2 weeks
- **Activities**:
  - Implement login and registration screens.
  - Integrate with Firebase Authentication or backend server for authentication (using email/password or Google Sign-In).
  - Add input validation to prevent errors during login or registration.

## 5. Backend API Integration (Retrofit)
- **Duration**: 2-3 weeks
- **Activities**:
  - Set up a connection to the backend using **Retrofit** to fetch recipes, perform searches, and manage favorites.
  - Implement API endpoints for key features like retrieving recipes, searching recipes, and saving favorites.
  - Ensure API connections are working correctly and data is displayed in the app.

## 6. Local Database (Room)
- **Duration**: 1-2 weeks
- **Activities**:
  - Implement **Room** for local storage to keep favorite recipes offline.
  - Create DAO (Data Access Object) for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in the favorites table.
  - Ensure data is saved correctly and accessible offline.

## 7. Main Features Development
- **Duration**: 3-4 weeks
- **Activities**:
  - **Home Page**: Display popular and recommended recipes.
  - **Search Page**: Implement recipe search using API and display results in a RecyclerView.
  - **Recipe Detail Page**: Show recipe details, nutritional information, and ingredients, with an option to mark as favorite.
  - **Favorites Page**: Display a list of user-marked favorite recipes.
  - **Profile Page**: Show user information and provide a logout option.

## 8. Testing (Unit & UI Testing)
- **Duration**: 2-3 weeks
- **Activities**:
  - Conduct unit testing on main app functions like authentication, favorite data storage, and API integration.
  - Perform **UI Testing** to ensure smooth app functionality and consistent design on various devices.
  - Use **Espresso** or **JUnit** for automated testing.

## 9. Debugging & Performance Optimization
- **Duration**: 1-2 weeks
- **Activities**:
  - Identify and fix any bugs found during testing.
  - Optimize app performance by ensuring efficient memory and battery usage.
  - Use **ProGuard** to minimize app size and secure code.

## 10. User Feedback & Iteration
- **Duration**: 1-2 weeks
- **Activities**:
  - Release a beta version to a small group of users for feedback.
  - Evaluate feedback and make adjustments to improve features and design.

## 11. Final Preparation & Launch
- **Duration**: 1 week
- **Activities**:
  - Prepare the app for upload to the Google Play Store.
  - Create an appealing description, screenshots, and icon for the Play Store page.
  - Launch the app and prepare for initial user responses.

## 12. Maintenance & Updates
- **Duration**: Ongoing
- **Activities**:
  - Monitor app for bugs or performance issues reported by users.
  - Release periodic updates to add new features or fix issues.
  - Gather continuous feedback from users for future iterations.
